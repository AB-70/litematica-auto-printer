I used Litematica Printer by Aleksilassila (@aleksilassila) as the base template for this mod. Please see the original repo for more details:

# How it Works

This modified version of Litematica Printer replicates the Litematica's "Paste Schematic" functionality, so instead
of placing blocks using player interaction, it uses commands to set blocks directly.

Please note that this mod only works in Single Player world and is intended for creation/recording purposes only.
